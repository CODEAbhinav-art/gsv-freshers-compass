(For aviation=40)\n9+ CGPA (especially to get AI-DS)\n2nd Factor is in my control, to get 9+ CGPA in GSV :-\nI'll Attend Classes Regularly with faculty interaction like asking genuine doubts(This builds my Face Value).\nI'll Make Proper Notes(Especially In subjects like Physics, IMCE, Mechanics, Design Thinking),80-90% of exam paper comes from notes directly most of the time.\nThe remaining 10-20% will get covered by Solving PYQ and some question practice from side books(For subjects like BEE ,Maths).\nFor things to do in Advance before joining College:-\nRefer to \"Get advantage before joining College\" section on the freshers website.\nScoring 9+ CGPA in GSV just requires a consistent study of 2 hours daily right from the start, don't get in the trap of \"baad me toh kar hi lenge, abhi toh college life start hui hai\" , I have to maintain balance between academics and non academics. Going Extreme will always hurt me."
