(For aviation=40)\n9+ CGPA (especially to get AI-DS)\n2nd Factor is in my control, to get 9+ CGPA in GSV :-\nI'll Attend Classes Regularly with faculty interaction like asking genuine doubts(This builds my Face Value).\nI'll Make Proper Notes(Especially In subjects like Physics, IMCE, Mechanics, Design Thinking),80-90% of exam paper comes from notes directly most of the time.\nThe remaining 10-20% will get covered by Solving PYQ and some question practice from side books(For subjects like BEE ,Maths).\nFor things to do in Advance before joining College:-\nRefer to \"Get advantage before joining College\" section on the freshers website.\nScoring 9+ CGPA in GSV just requires a consistent study of 2 hours daily right from the start, don't get in the trap of \"baad me toh kar hi lenge, abhi toh college life start hui hai\" , I have to maintain balance between academics and non academics. Going Extreme will always hurt me."

The club heads and other positions are elected by the current senior most person of that particular club who is going to retire from that position (It's like passing the baton on to the next trusted teammate). Meanwhile in GSV Clubs, collaboration and collective growth is the utmost priority therefore club positions are insignificant, every club member holds his/her voice equally in constructive manner whether he is coordinator or a support member. These positions are meant to guide the juniors and take the final decisions since they are the most experienced in the club."
